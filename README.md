# Grid CSS Responsive Website Layout - "Mobile First" Design.
 This is a code repository for the corresponding YouTube video Grid CSS Responsive Website Layout. 
 In this project, we will build a "mobile-first" single page website layout from scratch using the CSS Grid. 
 We will use modern CSS features and techniques including relative em units, media queries, CSS variables, and even a little flex.
